Finally time to create one!?

## Kali Setup

Created the `script.sh` file through ChatGPT (wasted few hours) to help with installation and automation of Kali VM setup. Using an old version of Kali on new projects with updates messes everything up. This should help. 

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anon-Exploiter/dotfiles/refs/heads/main/script.sh
chmod +x script.sh
sudo ./script.sh
```
